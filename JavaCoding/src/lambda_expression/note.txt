Q. What is lambda ?
Ans. It is an anonymous function.
	Its doesn't have name.
	Its doesn't have modifiers.
	Its doesn't have any return type. 
	
	To use Lambda Expression we need functional Interface.
	
Functional Interface: 
	1. It should contain exactly one abstract method.
	2. It can contain any number of default and static methods
	3. It act as an type for Lambda Expression.
		Interf i = () -> sopln("hello");
	4.It can be used to invoke Lambda Expression.
		i.m1();
	 
Q. Why Functional Interface contains only one abstract method ?
Ans.  Functional Interface were introduce to support Lambda Expression in java.
	 As Functional interface contains only one method hence when we write Lambda Expression
	 JVM is going to map that single method present in Interface with Lambda Expression and
	 infer the 'return type','parameter type', but if there are multiple methods present in 
	 Interface then there will be ambiguty.
